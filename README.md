This application is a simple bookstore management application

This application utilizes hashmap, queue, java swing and jdbc to manage MySQL database

You have to add the mysql-connector-java-8.0.30 jar file into the class path in order for the database integration to work

You also have to change the url, username and password in the MySQL.java file according to your own database in order to connect

Applying this application to another dialect of SQL should not be a problem as you would only have to change the Strings in the 
MySQL.java file according to the dialect you wish to use

This application is not fully complete and further changes will be made in the future
